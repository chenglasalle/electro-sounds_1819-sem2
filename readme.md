# Electro Sounds - Rotations

A project by Cheng Yu hung using P5.js for Electro-Sounds Semester 2.

## Project Description

‘Rotations’ is a coding project by Cheng Yu Hung. Is is reactive to Audio/Music. At its core. ‘Rotations’ has the rhodonea curve rotating in the middle. It becomes bigger when a louder signal is detected, goes back to a smaller version of itself when no signal is detected. The rhodonea curve has different variables in the equations which creates different the shapes.
There are 5 different backgrounds to choose from. First 2 are boxes followed by, sphere, cylinder and lastly a torus. These backgrounds are in 3D and it adds another dimension to the ever changing rhodonea curve in the middle which is in 2D.


## Reflection

Being very new to coding and programming in general, I found this project to be really difficult. It was hard to learn a new language and to apply it fluently in the p5.js editor. For the first few weeks of the lessons, we were doing project where we were trying to emulate digital art that has been posted online. I found it hard to even get started because I did not know how to even start to go about doing it. I found myself struggling and really lagging behind. Whenever I tried, there will be errors that I cannot solve. However, I could not just give up I need to really work on my project. I found things that I was interested in, had some sketches. Ultimately I came across the rhodonea curves which I found to be very versatile and gave me an aesthetic that I really liked. I am ultimately happy with what I got from this project, and I can definitely introduce this to my Live performances.

### Getting Started

While The Voxel Reactor is running, press Number Keys 1-9 to cycle through the different Visuals that act as the background. Number Key 0 can be used to return back to the default state.

-‘Rotations’ will run by itself , being audio reactive you can utilize your mic and speak into it or simply play some music. You can press Number Keys 1-5 for different backgrounds that will compliment the main sound reactive rhodonea curve.

-Please enable the microphone while interacting with this project.

-Work with any music, speech or sounds in general.
