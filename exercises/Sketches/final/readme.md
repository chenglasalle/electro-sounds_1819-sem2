### Getting Started

- ‘Rotations’ will run by itself , being audio reactive you can utilize your mic and speak into it or simply play some music. You can press Number Keys 1-5 for different backgrounds that will compliment the main sound reactive rhodonea curve.

- Please enable the microphone while interacting with this project.

- Work with any music, speech or sounds in general.
